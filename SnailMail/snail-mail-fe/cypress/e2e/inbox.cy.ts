/* TEST SUITE OVERVIEW 
   
    1) Check that a real, successful GET request to the backend works as expected
    2) Check that a real, successful GET request to the backend works as expected when there is no mail
    3) Check that a real, failed GET request is handled as expected
    4) Check that a fake GET inbox request (with mock data) to the backend works as expected
    5) Check that clicking the "compose email" button opens the Compose.tsx Component
