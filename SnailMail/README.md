# SnailMail
SnailMail is a basic Spring Boot + React TS application showcasing UI test suites written with Cypress and Playwright, and API test suites written with RestAssured.

## Features
None yet lol

## IF YOU PULL THIS APP TO USE LOCALLY -
- Pulled react apps don't have all of their dependencies installed (otherwise it would take FOREVER to push and pull the entire node_modules folder, which is .gitignored by default.) You need to run **npm install** from the command line inside your react app. The app will not work otherwise.
- The libraries we'll install in our React app are Axios, Bootstrap, Cypress, and Playwright.
